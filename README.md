# Modified Version
This is a modified version of the Awakebot for this specific Awake Feature shown in this Screenshot:
![alt text](https://i.gyazo.com/479277b5cd75e7317b9ec6a7bef90271.png "Feature")

Only works if you dont use the highlight awake feature that is available with this particular awaking method.
I won't upload a binary so you will have to build this yourself or use the original one since it already works for 
this feautre just not quite as well.

# Usage Instructions
1. Choose the correct config. If you server does not exist, make a config yourself by the guide down below. Then share it.

2. It's recommended to add a small awake delay of 0.5 seconds. Not needed if it ain't a laggy server.

3. Set all the item and scroll position by clicking the red buttons and dragging and releasing onto the specific item / scroll.

4. Click the last red button and a green transparent window will appear, drag and form a rectangle above the item awake text. It's needed in order for the bot to read the current awake. It's important that you also make the rectangle a little bigger incase a bigger awake appears.

5. Don't move the game window after you've set the positions and rectangle.

6. Add your preferred awake and value.

7. Click start and let it do it's job.

# Support your preferred server
1. Go into the config folder of the bot.

2. Make a new .xml file or make a copy of another already existing config and change it's name to the server you want to support.

3. Add or change the server's custom awakes in the new .xml file. Many servers have quite equal awakes, but some needs to be changed.

# FAQ
Q: My server is not showing up in the "Process Selector".  
A: Make sure the name of the game's client is "Neuz.exe". If not, change the name of the process in Settings.xml  
```xml
<Setting name="ProcessName">Neuz</Setting>
```

Q: The server is detecting it!  
A: Change the name of the folder containing the bot, the exe itself and the value of BotWindowName in Settings.xml  
```xml
<Setting name="BotWindowName">greyb1t's Flyff Awakebot</Setting>
```

Q: The server I'm playing on doesn't have scrolls. Only /awake command.  
A: Doesn't matter, just make the "Awake Pos" to the /awake command on the bottom bar in-game and "Reversion Pos" to an empty slot in the inventory.  

# Known problems and solutions
Error:
```
System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. --->
System.DllNotFoundException: Failed to find library "liblept172.dll" for platform x86 ...
```
**Solution:** Uninstall (probably not required) VC 2015 Redist x64 and install x86 instead.

# Requirements
.NET Framework 4.6.1  
VC 2015 Redist x86 (x64 will not work)  

# Changelog
**Version 1.01**
Fixed a bug with "Item Awake Read Rect" being unreachable.

**Version 1.02**
On e.g Magma Flyff, the time taken for a awake scroll to finish awakening the item is about 1 second. But on other servers, it's 200 ms.
Added a new option inside of the config to add a delay unique to that server of the time taken before an awake is done.

**Version 1.06**
Added possibilty to support non-english language servers.
Improved the accuracy of the bot and it's alot smarter.
The performance has been increased.
The bot is now basing it's interpretation on the server config and possible awakes.
A new setting has been added in the server config.

**Version 1.07**
Fixed memory leak.

**Version 1.08**
Hopefully fixed the OutOfMemoryException, turns out the error was not memory. It was caused by creating a bitmap out of bounds.

**Version 1.09**
Added an option to only click the "Awake Scroll Pos" once.
This adds the support for Augmentation Scroll and /awake command without wasting scrolls / money.

**Version 1.1**
Some small changes including adding a debug side bar to be able to identify possible issues with the bot not recognizing the awakes.
